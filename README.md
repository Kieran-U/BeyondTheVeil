- Better font
- Proper validation of suggestions. Must select series / creator. Must choose map location or cords. 
- Improve style of the location slab, provide mroe info!
- automate translation of data from google sheets to JSON format!

Suggestion Handling added using Google Sheets.
When submitted a console error is logged but the data transfers fine so I ignored it ;)
To add a new category of input to the form you must update, the HTML form, the POST js script, the AppsScript web app, the google sheet heading.
It might be worth upgrading to a real backend and database sometime in the future...
