**Beyond The Veil Fictional Map**

A map which contains all fictional & related locations you can visit.

Examples:
- Empire State Building - Site of Olympus in Percy Jackson
- Oxford Christ Church Staircase - Filming site of Hogwarts staircase Harry Potter
- Universal Studios Jurassic Park

As a kid, I always wanted to visit the Shire, explore the alleyways of Nepal, attend Hogwarts, and experience many more adventures. This map is meant to make finding and visiting some of these amazing locations easier, to allow those like me to experience, in part, those dreams.


**Suggest a Location**

Locations should be suggested from the map at kieran-u.github.io/BeyondTheVeil/
They are then manually verified and added.


**To Do**

The map still has many improvements to be made.
- Adapt for alternate screen sizes (+Mobile)
- Improve design of location information menu
- Add a feature to filter searchs by tags


**Credit**

This project is made possible by Leaflet which provides map integration.
